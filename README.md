# GotiBot | Discord Bot
Weird Discord bot created to learn about Discord.js and some TypeScript with Node

## Set up
If you (for some weird reason) want to run this Discord bot, you will need two keys/tokens in your environment variables:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN** | Your Discord bot token account |
| **RAWG_API_KEY** | rawg.io API key. Needed to obtain game information |

Once you have both keys set in your environment variables, open a terminal in the root folder of the project and install the node packages using:

```
npm install
```

When all the packages are installed, run the bot using:

```
npm start
```

Now you are ready to start to using this bot.
